##Introduction

###Justification for choice of experiment:
The study looks at children's understanding of social norms in cooperation, specifically their evaluation and sanction of free riding phenomenon. The paper is closely related to my research interest in children's social cognitive development. Most of my future work will be around social cognition & child studies, so I would prefer to do a replication on relevant topics.

###Description of Paper:
Across 6 studies, Yang et al.(2018) found that: children as young as 4 year olds negatively evaluate free riders, taking intention into consideration; children's negative valuations towards free riders are not only determined by group impact caused by free riding or nonconformity to the majority; children treat free riders with punishment, but contributors with reward; the similar patterns continue to exist when switching to a situation in which children play as first-parties.

I aim to replicate study 2 for this paper, where the result suggested that 4 to 5-year-olds negatively evaluate free riders. 

###Stimuli and procedures:

All the stimuli can be found on the OSF: https://osf.io/ke523/

Stimuli are pictures displayed on a laptop screen, along with the experimenter's description of the story context. Participants were presented with two scenarios in which four members worked together in a group to achieve a common goal. If all four members contributed, the group could get a big reward; if only three of them contributed, the reward would only be a small one. The scenarios have two versions: free rider withholding resources vs. free rider withholding effort. In the former version, donating four chocolates to a piggybank won the group a bigger cake and donating plants into a garden produced more tomatoes. In the latter version, donation was replaced by cleaning the dirty piggy bank and growing the tomatoes. Half of the children heared the donation version, and half of them heared the effort version. In terms of intention, each subject heard two scenarios, one involving a free-rider unwilling to contribute (intentional condition), one involving a free-rider willing but unable to contribute (unintentional condition).

The procedures were as below:

-Introduction about the game rules (Memory Check for Children's Understanding of the rules)

-Free riding story - Scenario 1 (Intentional/Unintentional)

-Evaluation/Preference Questions  (Contributor & Free rider)

-Free riding story - Scenario 2 (Unintentional/Intentional)

-Evaluation/Preference Questions  (Contributor & Free rider)


###Anticipated Challenges:
1. Data collection with children will bring me much more work to do than using Amazon Mechanical Turk.

2. Need to connect to Bing Nursery School.

##Methods

###Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

###Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

###Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

###Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.


###Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

###Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.


##Results


### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
###Data Preparation

####Load Relevant Libraries and Functions

####Import data

#### Data exclusion / filtering

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.
```

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

###Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
